The conventional process for extracting lithium from brines requires large evaporation ponds that are environmentally damaging, slow to start up, and vulnerable to weather. This conventional process suffers from low lithium recovery, low product purity, and is ineffective for most new brine discoveries with lower grades of lithium. Lithium producers are seeking new extraction methods.</p>"}
    - {name: bodyText, heading: "Unparalleled Performance", preamble: "A new process", body: "<p>Lilac has developed and patented a new ion exchange technology to extract lithium from brines without the need for evaporation ponds. Our technology protects the environment while accelerating project development, increasing recovery, and yielding a high-purity product. Ion exchange has been successfully deployed in a wide variety of water treatment and metals processing applications, but has never been successfully applied to lithium, until now. Lilac’s new ion exchange beads and modules unlock this powerful technology for the lithium industry.</p>"}
