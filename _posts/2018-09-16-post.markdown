excerpt: "Lilac dramatically decreases the volumes of reagents that need to be trucked in, so we can unlock resources in remote locations. On top of this, our technology is modular so the physical footprint of our facilities is approximately 1,000 times smaller than conventional lithium brine projects using evaporation ponds"
